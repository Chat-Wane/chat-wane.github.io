		Many distributed protocols and applications rely on
		causal broadcast to ensure consistency
		criteria. However, none of causality tracking
		state-of-the-art approaches scale in large and dynamic
		systems. This paper presents a new non-blocking causal
		broadcast protocol suited for dynamic systems. The
		proposed protocol outperforms state-of-the-art in size
		of messages, execution time complexity, and local
		space complexity. Most importantly, messages piggyback
		control information the size of which is constant. We
		prove that for both static and dynamic
		systems. Consequently, large and dynamic systems can
		finally afford causal broadcast.

		Peer-sampling protocols constitute a fundamental

		<p>Collaborative editors allow users to distribute the

		Real-time collaborative editors are common tools to distribute
		work across space, time, and organizations. Unfortunately,
		mainstream editors such as Google Docs rely on central servers
		and raises privacy and scalability issues. CRATE is a real-time
		decentralized collaborative editor that runs directly in web
		browsers thanks to WebRTC. Compared to state-of-the-art, CRATE
		is the first real-time editor that only requires browsers in
		order to support collaborative editing and to transparently
		handle from small to large groups of users. Consequently, CRATE
		can also be used in massive online lectures, TV shows or large
		conferences to allow users to share their notes. CRATE's
		properties rely on two scientific results: (i) a replicated
		sequence structure with sub-linear upper bound on space
		complexity; this prevents the editor from running costly
		distributed garbage collectors, (ii) an adaptive peer sampling
		protocol; this prevent the editor from oversizing routing
		tables, hence from letting small networks pay the price of large
		networks. This paper describes CRATE, its properties and its
		usage.

		Distributed collaborative editing systems allow users to work
		distributed in time, space and across organizations. Trending
		distributed collaborative editors such as Google Docs, Etherpad
		or Git have grown in popularity over the years. A new kind of
		distributed editors based on a family of distributed data
		structure replicated on several sites called Conflict-free
		Replicated Data Type (CRDT for short) appeared recently. This
		paper considers a CRDT that represents a distributed sequence of
		basic elements that can be lines, words or characters (sequence
		CRDT). The possible operations on this sequence are the
		insertion and the deletion of elements. Compared to the state of
		the art, this approach is more decentralized and better scales
		in terms of the number of participants. However, its space
		complexity is linear with respect to the total number of inserts
		and the insertion points in the document. This makes the overall
		performance of such editors dependent on the editing behaviour
		of users. This paper proposes and models LSEQ, an adaptive
		allocation strategy for a sequence CRDT. LSEQ achieves in the
		average a sub-linear spatial-complexity whatever is the editing
		behaviour. A series of experiments validates LSEQ showing that
		it outperforms existing approaches.

		Distributed collaborative editors such as Google Docs or
		Etherpad allow to distribute the work across time, space and
		organizations. In this paper, we focus on distributed
		collaborative editors based on the Conflict-free Replicated Data
		Type approach (CRDT). CRDTs encompass a set of well-known data
		types (sets, graphs, sequences, etc.). CRDTs for sequences model
		a document as a set of elements (character, line, paragraph,
		etc.) with unique identifiers, providing two commutative update
		operations: insert and delete. The identifiers of elements can
		be either of fixed-size or variable-size. Recently, a strategy
		for assigning variable-size identifiers called LSEQ has been
		proposed for CRDTs for sequences. LSEQ lowers the space
		complexity of variable-size identifiers CRDTs from linear to
		sub-linear. While experiments show that it works locally, it
		fails to provide this bound with multiple users and latency. In
		this paper, we propose h-LSEQ, an improvement of LSEQ that
		preserves its space complexity among all collaborators,
		regardless of the latency. Ultimately, this improvement allows
		to safely build distributed collaborative editors based on
		CRDTs. We validate our approach with simulations involving
		latency and multiple users.
